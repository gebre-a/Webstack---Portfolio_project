Description of the Project
	Project Description
	Objective:
	to create a web application that simulates the functionalities of a real bookstore. The app should allow users to browse through a list of 
	books, search for specific titles, add them to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout.
Scope:	
	● Clarify that the project focuses on building a functional and user-friendly interface for customers while ensuring the backend can efficiently 
	handle data management and user requests.
 Learning Objectives
	Front-End:
	● Increase my knowledge of React.js, particularly in building dynamic, responsive web pages that offer a smooth user experience.
	Back-End:
	● Increase my Node.js, focusing on creating a scalable server-side application that can handle various requests from the front end.
	Database:
	MongoDB for database management,to store, retrieve, and manipulate data effectively.
	MongoDB was the chosen database due to its flexibility and scalability, particularly for 
	handling JSON-like data structures.
Integration:
	● I understand how integrating all parts of the application, from the front end to the 
	back end, ensuring that they work together seamlessly to deliver a complete product.
